Some of the work that might be interesting:
- [Decision Trees - Exercise.ipynb](https://github.com/tansla/HWs_git/blob/master/Decision%20Trees%20-%20Exercise.ipynb) - Decision Trees algorythm from scratch
- [Ensemble_Learning_Exercise.ipynb](https://github.com/tansla/HWs_git/blob/master/Ensemble_Learning_Exercise.ipynb) - Random forest algorythm, based on sklearn DecisionTreeRegressor 
- [NB_exercise.ipynb](https://github.com/tansla/HWs_git/blob/master/NB_exercise.ipynb) - classification on MNIST dataset


Files that started with "H_W_" are homeworks of Deep Learning course.

Homeworks were done in pairs, so my special thanks to my study partners: [@AndreyKap](https://github.com/AndreyKap), [@Ranyrotem](https://github.com/Ranyrotem), [@neumanh](https://github.com/neumanh)
